I'm not patient enough to make this work for every system so here is a python script to build it if the exe does not work.

run this command from the directory of the script.

You will need python, and pyinstaller, which can be a bitch to get working if you are not familiar - Good luck.

I've also included it as a .bat script called README_buildexe.bat

here is the script:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=ck2_icon.ico --add-data "background.png;." CK2-MAP.py
