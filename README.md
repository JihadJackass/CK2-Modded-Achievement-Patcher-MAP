# CK2 MAP Tool
 Crusader Kings 2 Modded Achievement Patcher (MAP)

 **Instructions:**
1. Start the CK2 launcher.
2. Run the tool either via the python script (CK2-MAP.py) or (**PREFFERED**) via the .exe in the DIST folder **as Administrator**
3. Apply the patch using this tool each time you run the CK2Launcher/CK2 (it **MUST be run in the launcher**)
4. Start the game and play with mods in Ironman mode.
5. You must use the tool each time you launch CK2, it is currently unable to patch automatically, but I will add this feature soon.

# How to use the tool

# .EXE (**PREFERRED METHOD**)

There is an included exe in the releases and /dist folder which SHOULD run, and not require any Python. I cannot really help if this fails you
- You can try building it as stated above and I have included instructions in BUILD_README_FIRST via README_buildexe.bat
- # RELEASES:

- # EXE LOCATION:

# Python

Included is the python script, and a build script if you wish to build it into an .EXE (though ironically, this requires Python if you wish to build - so it is up to you really)
- **I highly recommend the exe as it is user friendly**
