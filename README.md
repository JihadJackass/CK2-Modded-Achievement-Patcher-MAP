# Python (**PREFERRED METHOD**)

Included is the python script, and a build script if you wish to build it into an .EXE (though ironically, this requires Python - so it is up to you really)

# .EXE

There is an included exe in the releases and /dist folder. I cannot really help if this fails you
- You can try building it as stated above and I have included instructions in BUILD_README_FIRST via README_buildexe.bat
